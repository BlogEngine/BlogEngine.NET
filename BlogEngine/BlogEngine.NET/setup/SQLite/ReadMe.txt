Running BlogEngine.NET using SQLite:

If you wish to use SQLite to store all your blog data, this is the guide for you.
Included in this folder is a default SQLite database, that you can use to get you 
started with your blog.  In addition, you will find a sample web.config file with
the needed changes to use SQLite and an upgrade scripts for current SQLite users 
who wish to upgrade from previous version.

Instructions for new setup:

1. Copy System.Data.SQLite.DLL from the /setup/SQLite to your blog's bin folder.
2. Copy BlogEngine.s3db from the SQLite folder to your App_Data folder.
3. Rename SQLiteWeb.Config to Web.config and copy it to your blog folder.  (This will
overwrite your existing web.config file.  If this is not a new installation, make sure 
you have a backup).
4. Surf out to your Blog and see the welcome post.
5. Login with the username Admin and password admin.  Change the password.  Note: This 
data is case sensitive.
