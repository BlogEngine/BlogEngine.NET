    <description>I tried to use the standard and newest technology codes like CSS3, HTMl5, jQuery, etc. in this theme. FlatBlog is simple, but is designed by beautiful colors like, gray and blue. This theme is not designed for special groups and its public. It is interesting to know that this theme is responsive design, It means that it is visible in the most devices with different resolutions. So you can choose this theme as Mobile theme. The theme has five buttons for social networks and ..., that you can add your account link for following. You can send email to Me [at] seyfolahi.net to report the theme's bugs.</description>
